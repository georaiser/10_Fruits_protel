# 🍎 Fruits ProTEL Classification with EfficientNetV2 🍊

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning image classification model to identify fresh fruits using the ProTEL dataset. It leverages the EfficientNetV2 architecture, employing transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques to achieve optimal performance in fruit classification.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
### 📊 Data Preparation and Handling
The project uses a custom dataset class to load and preprocess images. Data is split into train, validation, and test sets using a custom function. Only "Fresh" fruit categories are selected for classification.

### 🧠 Model Architecture
The project utilizes the EfficientNetV2-S model with pre-trained weights. The base layers are frozen to preserve learned features, and a custom classifier head is added to match the number of fruit classes.

### 🏋️ Training Process
The training process implements a custom EarlyStopping class to prevent overfitting. It uses CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer, and applies learning rate scheduling with ReduceLROnPlateau. The training loop is encapsulated in a run_model function from a custom engine_classification module.

### 📈 Visualization and Evaluation
The project implements functions to plot loss and accuracy curves, and provides functionality to visualize sample predictions on test images.
